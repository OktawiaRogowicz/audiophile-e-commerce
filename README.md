This is a solution to the <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/rock-paper-scissors-game-pTgwgvgH">Audophile e-commerce challenge on Frontend Mentor</a>! 

My fifth encounter with Frontend Mentor, where I finally attempt an actual commercial website. It tested not only my React-specific abilities, but also challenged with cart creation and reading JSON objects.

<h1><code>Overview</code></h1>

>Users should be able to:
>
>- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
>- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
>- Add/Remove products from the cart
>- Edit product quantities in the cart
>- Fill in all fields in the checkout
>- Receive form validations if fields are missed or incorrect during checkout
>- See correct checkout totals depending on the products in the cart
>  - Shipping always adds $50 to the order
>  - VAT is calculated as 20% of the product total, excluding shipping
>- See an order confirmation modal after checking out with an order summary
>- **Bonus**: Keep track of what's in the cart, even after refreshing the browser (`localStorage` could be used for this if you're not building out a full-stack app)

### What I learned
This project definitelly challenged me in more than one way. While I felt comfortable with my CSS skills already, it definitelly pust my React knowledge to test, checking the way I build components and create the page. As it turns out, Routes can be used as a "page builder" while using components - and I definitelly didn't know that!

### Continued development
Currently, I plan on changing the way I actually implemented the cart - instead of using a context, Redux implementation would probably make more sense, but I wanted to finish one version of a website first before attempting to rebuild it whole with an library completely new to me.
